### About myself:
Hello. I live in the Republic of Belarus in the city of Nesvizh. At the age of 26, I tried various fields: marketing, sales, technical specialist, etc. I have discovered the field of programming recently, but it is very interesting and suitable for me. I hope to become a JS developer soon and get my first job.

Among the strengths I can mention: attentiveness, perseverance, scrupulousness, desire to learn.
